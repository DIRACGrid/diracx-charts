# Details of `run_demo.sh`

## What `run_demo.sh` does

In order to run the `diracx charts` locally, this script:

1. Downloads various utilities (`kind`, `helm`, `kubectl`, etc)
2. Starts a local kubernetes using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
3. Installs the `chart` using `helm`, enabling all the dependencies (DBs, IdP, Object store, etc)
4. Generate the initial configuration for all the dependencies and `diracx` (db credentials, urls of services, create admin users, etc)

All this relies on templated configuration in the [demo](../demo/) directory. A temporary folder (`diracx-charts/.demo`) is used to generate the actual config and host various tools. It is important for this directory to have a deterministic location as it is used by the `diracx` integration tests.

## Intended audience

There are three intended users of the `run_demo.sh` script:

* Developers
* Installation admins (or potential new DIRAC administrators)
* DiracX testing

As such it has a fairly complex set of possible options to configure it's behavior:

```bash
$ ./run_demo.sh
--8<-- "docs/dev/explanations/run_demo_help.txt"
```

## Mounted containers

`kind` creates a docker container, and runs kubernetes inside. In order to avoid that `kind` downloads the `diracx` and dependencies images everytime, `run_demo.sh` creates a docker volume `diracx-demo-containerd` that is mounted in the container in which the images are stored.
This volume could grow very large, do not forget to clean it up regularely, as suggested by the `run_demo.sh` script

``bash
⚠️ Volume for containerd is 21 GB, if you want to save space shutdown the demo and run "docker volume rm diracx-demo-containerd"
``

## DiracX configuration

The configuration yaml used by the `diracx` service is a mounted directory: `diracx-charts/.demo/cs-mount`.  This means that if you want to change the configuration of diracx, you can just edit `diracx-charts/.demo/cs-mount/initRepo/default.yml` and `git commit` this file. Note that the `diracx-charts/.demo/cs-mount` is a git repository in itself, and that's where you should go and commit. Do not attempt to commit anything under `diracx-charts/.demo/` in the `diracx-charts` repo (it is in the `.gitignore`)

## Coverage volume

In order for the `diracx CI` to collect and aggregate coverage report, a local path is mounted inside the container `diracx-charts/.demo/coverage-reports`.

## Mounted python module

Because you may want to test changes in `diracx` itself, or `DIRAC` or any other python package, listing these packages at the end of the `run_demo.sh` command line will mount these directories and (by default) perform an editable install of these packages.

Effectively, that means that you can do `diracx-charts/run_demo.sh <mydiracxcheckout>`, edit the code of your `diracx` checkout, and see it run directly in the demo.

## Mounted node module
Because you may want to test changes in `diracx-web` itself, appending the package at the end of the `run_demo.sh` command line will mount the directory and (by default) perform an editable install of the package.
Effectively, that means that you can do `diracx-charts/run_demo.sh <mydiracx-webcheckout>`, edit the code of your `diracx-web` checkout, and see it run directly in the demo.

## CA certificates

The `run_demo.sh` generates a self signed certificate and dumps it in `diracx-charts/.demo/demo-ca.pem` to allow for a local client to interact with it.


## Secret generation

Multiple secrets are needed for `diracx` to run. In the case of the demo, they are auto generated, and are persisted during `helm upgrade`
