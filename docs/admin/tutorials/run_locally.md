## Intro to Kubernetes and Helm

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) (k8s) allows you to deploy containerized applications while letting you abstract the underlying infrastructure. The configuration of your application and how you run it is communicated to k8s via ``yaml`` files.

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) allows to template these ``yaml`` files. Such a templated description of an application like ``diracx`` is called ``chart``. Helm also allows to manage dependencies between ``charts``. For example, the ``diracx`` application needs a database to run, so the ``diracx charts`` has a dependency on the ``mysql charts``.

To understand this ``chart`` you will need to familiarize yourself with a few k8s concepts:
* A ``node`` is one of the machine (VM, physical) which sustains your k8s cluster.
* Your application runs inside a container which is part of a ``pod``. A ``pod`` is the atomic unit with which kubernetes will work, and in most cases it corresponds to a single container. ``pods`` are deployed on ``nodes``.
* A ``ReplicaSet`` represents how many ``pods`` of a given type you want to run. For example, you want to run 3 ``pods`` containing the ``diracx`` container for redundancy reasons.
* A ``Deployment`` is how you describe your workload to k8s. It ensures that any number of replicas of your ``pod`` are running (via ``ReplicaSEt``). This chart contains a ``deployment`` for ``diracx`` (see [here](diracx/templates/diracx/deployment.yaml)), and a ``deployment`` for ``diracx-web`` (see [here](diracx/templates/diracx-web/deployment.yaml)). Kubernetes will always make sure that the ``deployment`` is satisfied.
* A ``Service`` is how you expose your ``Deployment``. If I want to talk to my ``diracx`` application, it is a ``Service`` which will take care of redirecting me within the cluster to one of the ``pod``. Most of the time, the ``Service`` is used for routing inside the cluster
* An ``Ingress`` exposes your ``Services`` outside of the cluster.

If you are not familiar with the above concepts, we recommend you follow the [Kubernetes tutorial](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/).

## Running DiracX locally

It is possible to run an instance of DiracX locally for demo or testing purposes. This entails running a local kubernetes cluster, installing this helm chart and all its dependencies, and configuring it accordingly.

!!! warning

    This setup is **not** suitable for a production or long-lived deployment. To learn how to run a long-lived deployment, see [the how-to](../how-to/installing.md).

In order to make that easy, we wrote the ``run_demo.sh`` script, which covers all these needs. This is also used for the [diracx ci](https://github.com/DIRACGrid/diracx/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml)

### ``run_demo.sh``

This is the script used to start a demo or the integration tests.


```
--8<-- "docs/admin/tutorials/run_demo_help.txt"
```

Once ready, you will get some information on how to interact with your cluster

```md
NOTES:

🚧 Chart has been installed in developer mode.

ℹ️  To interact with the cluster directly using kubectl/helm you'll need to set the
first following environment variables:

  export KUBECONFIG=/home/chaen/dirac/diracx-project/diracx-charts/.demo/kube.conf
  export HELM_DATA_HOME=/home/chaen/dirac/diracx-project/diracx-charts/.demo/helm_data
  export PATH=${PATH}:/home/chaen/dirac/diracx-project/diracx-charts/.demo

Then see the chart README for more information on how to use kubectl/helm.

ℹ️  To use the demo with the DiracX client set:

  export DIRACX_URL=https://172.18.0.1.nip.io:8000
  export DIRACX_CA_PATH=/home/chaen/dirac/diracx-project/diracx-charts/.demo/demo-ca.pem

ℹ️  To use the demo with a DiracX client without local installation:

  kubectl exec -it  deployment/diracx-demo-cli -- bash

ℹ️  To access the web application visit:

  https://172.18.0.1.nip.io:8000

ℹ️  To access the interactive API documentation visit:

  https://172.18.0.1.nip.io:8000/api/docs

ℹ️  When prompted to login the credentials are:

  Username: admin@example.com
  Password: password

ℹ️  Grafana dashboard for telemetry (if enabled)

  https://172.18.0.1.nip.io:32004

  Username: admin
  Password: run ``kubectl get secrets diracx-demo-grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode ; echo``

### Interacting with the demo

#### Kubernetes basics

Assuming you have exported the environment variables printed by the demo script you can interact with the demo cluster using:

```bash
# List the running pods
kubectl get pods
# Get some more information about a pod
kubectl describe pod/<pod name>
# Show the logs of a running pod
kubectl logs <pod name>
# Show the logs of a running pod and keep following them
kubectl logs -f <pod name>
# Run a command in one of the pods
kubectl exec -it <pod name> -- /bin/bash /entrypoint.sh
```

#### Helm basics

When running the demo,  an `values.yaml` file is created as `.demo/values.yaml`.
This file can be used with helm to interact with the running demo to make changes to what is running in the cluster.

```bash

# Show what will be changed by running "helm upgrade"
# Note: helm diff has a ``bug`` that requires you to specify the existing password
# https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff/issues/460

export RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace "default" rabbitmq-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.rabbitmq-password}" | base64 -d)
export MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace "default" mysql-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.mysql-root-password}" | base64 -d)
export MYSQL_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace "default" mysql-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.mysql-password}" | base64 -d)

helm diff upgrade diracx-demo  ./diracx --values .demo/values.yaml --set rabbitmq.auth.password=$RABBITMQ_PASSWORD  --set mysql.auth.rootPassword=$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD --set mysql.auth.password=$MYSQL_PASSWORD

# Actually run "helm upgrade" to apply changes
helm upgrade diracx-demo ./diracx --values .demo/values.yaml
```

See [here](../../../dev/explanations/run_demo.md) for more details on what you can do to alter the behavior of the local installation.


## OpenTelemetry

> :warning: **Experimental**: opentelemetry is an evolving product, and so is our implementation of it.

``diracx`` aim at relying on [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) for traces, monitoring and logging. When running in demo mode, this chart can spawn the necessary component for the telemetry to be reported:
* OpenTelemetry-collector to collect all the data
* Prometheus for the metrics
* Jaeger for traces
* ElasticSearch for logs (OpenSearch not yet supported)
* Grafana to display all that (accessible on port 32004 of the demo)

To enable it, run ``run_demo.sh`` with ``enable-open-telemetry``

Note that this configuration is trivial and does not follow production recommandations (like using batch processing)
