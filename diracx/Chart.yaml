  This helm chart is intended to be used in two ways:

   * Development: The ./run_demo.sh script allows the infrastructure to be ran locally with docker+kind
   * Production: TODO

type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: "1.0.0-alpha.2"

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
